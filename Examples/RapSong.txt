  fuck
That's how you end up on the receiving end of a few dick Pops
And a few niggas but their a crew banger too ('cause fuck that) and they into R&B
And this is how you end up in the bizzles, all up in your emotions
Can't you see the irony?
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, and tested
And it ain't worked, it's been tried, and tested
'Til somebody comes along that just pop's blues
That's when we know we're in crisis
'Til someone comes along that just pop's blues
That's when we know we're in crisis
Until then, I'm just happy to be alive
And if you'll excuse me, I'm sad
I'm a failure as Rap God but I'm a genius
I know how to turn failure into success
If I can just become less of a failure and more of
